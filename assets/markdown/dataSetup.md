# Demo data setup

## User story
To proceed with the demo data setup, you might want to click the **"User story"** button below to read about how the coffee coupon system is supposed to work. The user story is a bit verbose, you don't have to read it in full yet. I will summarize some important points for you as follows.

(Detailed information about these demo users and guests, including passwords, can be found in the NEXT pages.)
